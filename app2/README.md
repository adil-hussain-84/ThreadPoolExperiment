# An analysis of using the ThreadPoolExecutor class as a means of achieving a sequential queue

This module is a simple, single-screen Android application that compares
the [ThreadPoolExecutor](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor)
class and the [synchronized](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/syncmeth.html)
keyword as a means of achieving a sequential queue.

When you run the app, you will see an interface as below. The text in the interface describes the purpose of
